## ATT&CK Tags

**Tactic:** Credential Access (TA0006)

**Technique:** Steal Application Access Token (T1528)

## Technical description of the attack

In order to evade detection an attacker may use binaries that mimic a trusted certificate or modified signed binaries to make outbound network connections for various reasons. The binary can also be completely unsigned which stands out even more.

## Permission required to execute the technique

Access to the device or service where the service principal is being used, such as a CI/CD pipeline running on GitHub Actions.

## Detection description

By combining the network Microsoft Graph Activity Logs and the SignInEvents towards the difference between IP addresses we have a fairly trustworthy means of detection.

## Utilized Data Source

| Event ID | Event Name                    | Log Provider | ATT&CK Data Source |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| -        | MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs    | Entra ID     | Cloud Service      |
| -        | AADManagedIdentitySignInLogs  | Entra ID     | Cloud Service      |
| -        | AADServicePrincipalSignInLogs | Entra ID     | Cloud Service      |

## Hunt details

### KQL

**FP Rate:** _Low_

**Source:** _Entra ID_

**Description:** _This detection looks at differences within the IP adresses between the access token issuance and usage._

**Query:**

```kusto
// Hunt for differences between the token issuance and token usage IP address of entra users
// As devices can potentially move or change public IPs, this query might introduce more FPs.
// e.g. users switching to a different Wi-Fi or a mobile hotspot
MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(2h)
| where ResponseStatusCode between (100 .. 300 ) // only include success status codes
| lookup kind=inner (
    union SigninLogs, AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs
) on $left.SignInActivityId == $right.UniqueTokenIdentifier
| extend SigninInIPAddress = IPAddress1, ActivityIPAddress = IPAddress
| where SigninInIPAddress != ActivityIPAddress
//| project TimeGenerated, AppDisplayName, SigninInIPAddress, ActivityIPAddress, UserAgent, UserAgent1
```

## Considerations

- Only MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs with a corresponding SignIn are considered (due to inner join).

## False Positives

## Detection Blind Spots
